# language-recognition

simple python machine learning program to recognize language of given text. The key principle used to evaluate a language is knowing that all letters occur with different frequecy depending on a language. With this in mind my program recives a database of some texts (in this case in 3 different languages: Polish, English and Norvegian) and evaluates the frequecy of each letter in those languages. After analyzing the database program is able to recognize language used in a text in all 3 of those languages.
